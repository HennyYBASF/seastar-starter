# Seastar starter project

This project contains a small [Seastar](https://github.com/scylladb/seastar)
program and minimal cmake scaffolding. The example contains both coroutines
and continuation passing style uses of Seastar, and requires C++20.

# Getting started

Install dependencies (assuming a recent verison of Ubuntu such as 22.04):

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
seastar/install-dependencies.sh
apt-get install -qq ninja-build clang
```

Configure and build:

```
cmake -Bbuild -S. -GNinja
ninja -C build
```

Run the example program `./main --msg sup`:

```
build/main --msg sup
```

Similar output to the following should be produced:

```
